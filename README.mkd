# cascading-simhash

Say you have a large corpus of web documents and you want to group
them together by some notion of "similarity". For instance, we may
want to detect plagiarism or find content that appears on multiple
places on a site. In this scenario it is impractical to do a pairwise
comparison of all documents. Fortunately, we can use simhashing.

Broadly speaking, simhashing is a algorithm that calculates a "group
id" (the minimum hash, or <em>minhash</em>) from the content. Because
the minhash for an item is calculated independently of the other items
in the set, minhashing is an ideal candidate for MapReduce.
